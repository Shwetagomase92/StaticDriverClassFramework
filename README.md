Framework contains the static test class method to call in its driver class. 
My Framework is about:
it is the improved framework of previous reference class framework.
Features:
1st we made request repository class. 2nd we made test class. 3rd we made common function methods and lastly we made driver class to drive entire execution of my framework.
we also use the for loop to retrieve the status code.
Improvements needed:
driver class should be generic. it reads data which is given by manual tester in excel format.
